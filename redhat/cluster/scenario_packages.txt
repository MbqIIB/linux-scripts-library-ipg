Now let’s see what kind of packages/installations we need to configure this setup successfully. The following packages/RPMs can be downloaded by rpmfind.net.

Ricci (ricci-0.16.2-75.el6.x86_64.rpm)
Luci (luci-0.26.0-63.el6.centos.x86_64.rpm)
Mod_cluster (modcluster-0.16.2-29.el6.x86_64.rpm)
CCS (ccs-0.16.2-75.el6_6.2.x86_64.rpm)
CMAN(cman-3.0.12.1-68.el6.x86_64.rpm)
Clusterlib (clusterlib-3.0.12.1-68.el6.x86_64.rpm)
Let’s see what each installation does for us and their meanings.

Ricci is a daemon which used for cluster management and configurations. It distributes/dispatches receiving messages to the nodes configured.

Luci is a server that runs on the cluster management server and communicates with other multiple nodes. It provides a web interface to make things easier.

Mod_cluster is a load balancer utility based on httpd services and here it is used to communicate the incoming requests with the underlying nodes.

CCS is used to create and modify the cluster configuration on remote nodes through ricci. It is also used to start and stop the cluster services.

CMAN is one of the primary utilities other than ricci and luci for this particular setup, since this acts as the cluster manager. Actually, cman stands for 
CLUSTER MANAGER. It is a high-availability add-on for RedHat which is distributed among the nodes in the cluster.
